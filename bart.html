        <p>The objective of this game is to get the largest number of points
          by pumping balloons.
        </p>
        <p>You will see one balloon at a time on the screen, which you can pump
          as many times as you want, or stop whenever you want. Each pump adds 10 points to the
          balloon.
        </p>
        <p>The more you pump, the more points you get. But the more you pump,
          the higher the chance that it will explode.
        </p>
        <p>If a balloon explodes, you lose all points you were accumulating from it.
          Whereas if you stop pumping (clicking the button "Stop"), you accumulate all points you
          got from the balloon so far.
        </p>
        <p>You can see on the top right corner of the screen how many points you got so far (that is, points
          you accumulated in previous rounds), how many you lost in previous rounds, and how many a competitor
          accumulated by the end of the current round.
        </p>
        <p>Try to do better than the competitor!
        </p>
        <p>After 12 rounds, the game is over. Come back in 2 weeks!

      <p>You have already participated this week! Instead of blowing more balloons,
      how about having friends over for a barbecue, going antique shopping, or sitting
      at your grandma's piano for a while to practice a bit?</p>
      <p>Just some ideas...</p>
      <p><strong>Have a worthwhile day, and please come back in 2 weeks.</strong> We'll have
      more balloons ready for you by then.</p>
