# webBART
Web version of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), with modifications for non-monetary data collection and added feature for visualizing an updated opponent's performance at each round.

Developed for use in psychological/psychiatric clinical practice in or out of sessions as a measure or monitor of risk-taking propensity, in a non-invasive, harm-free, ethics-compliant, and user-friendly way.
